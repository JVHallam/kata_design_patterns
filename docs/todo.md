# Suggestion:
* A base class / base implementation
* A creation pattern
* A structural pattern
* A behavioural pattern
    * You create a base, via the creation pattern, then something else, then the behavioural pattern kicks in
    * You should really build these katas from Behavioural downward, but learn them from base upward
* The hello world for each of the above get put into my warm ups

----------------------------------------------------
DI - would go with this group
Chain of responbility
Iterator - Nice to know

Ones that sound wild:
State - changes it class based on it's state

-----------------------------------------------------

# Factories:
* Factory pattern
* Inheritance and base classes

# Design pattern that kinda make sense
* Proxy -> it's like lazy evaluation for big objects
    * A text document -> An Images' proxy -> An Image
    * The image isn't instantiated until proxy is invoked
    * Proxy has the same interface as the Image class, forwards all requests to the image, but doesn't
      create the image until the first call.

# Behvaiour Design patterns I have no idea about
*  Chain of responsibility
*  Command - It sounds like a transaction of requests
*  Interpretter - Just sounds like a translator kinda meme
*  Iterator/cursor - It's a class that allows you to move through a list, and keeps track of where you are and what's next for you.
    * Could be useful for iterating over elements in a graph
*  Memento - Save the state of an object, so it can be restored later
*  Observer - It's publish subscribe event driven stuff
*  State - Change behaviour based on state
*  Mediator - 
*  Strategy - 
*  Visitor - 

# Structural Design patterns i have no idea about
* Adapter - 
* Bridge - 
* Composite - 
* Decorator - 
* Facade
* Flyweight - 

# Creation design patterns i have no idea about
* Singleton - Like why would i even ?
